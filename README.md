# Batik-Motif-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Transfer-Learning
This project involves the use of deep learning models to classify Indonesian batik motifs. By utilizing deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning, this project aims to automatically identify three well-known batik motifs: Parang, Mega Mendung, and Kawung.
